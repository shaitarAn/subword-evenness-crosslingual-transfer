## Overview

Pre-trained multilingual models like **mBERT**, **XLM-R**, and **mT5** are widely used to improve performance on NLP tasks in **low-resource languages** via **cross-lingual transfer**. Traditionally, English is chosen as the transfer language, but recent evidence shows this may not be optimal.

This project introduces **Subword Evenness (SuE)** â€” a novel metric that predicts the effectiveness of a source language in cross-lingual transfer. We demonstrate that **non-Latin, non-alphabetic scripts** (e.g., Asian languages) tend to yield better results in **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** tasks for a diverse set of 30 low-resource languages.

## My Contribution

As second author and contributor, I was responsible for:

- Preparing multilingual Hugging Face `Dataset` objects from raw text for over 30 low- and high-resource languages, including genre balancing, token curation, and metadata management  
- Designing and running training pipelines for **mBERT** and **mT5** using Hugging Face scripts, including checkpointing, perplexity evaluation, and correlation analysis across language pairs  
- Setting up and maintaining experiment infrastructure across multiple servers, optimizing training parameters, and automating evaluation workflows  
- Co-authoring the paper and supporting documentation
